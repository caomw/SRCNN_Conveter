# SRCNN (C++ Converter)
This is a simple reimplementation of [SRCNN](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/SRCNN.html), in C++, using OpenCV.  
SRCNN(Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network) is a super-resolution algorithm, you can use this converter for image scaling. 
## Simple Introduction
I write this converter in my undergraduate thesis project in March 2015.   
Inspired by [waifu2x](https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x), I decided to put my code in github and improve it.   
waifu2x is also a super-resolution project follow the idea of SRCNN, but there is not only super-resolution but also image denoise in waifu2x.   
Compare to waifu2x, my code is not perfect and there are many advantages worth learning in waifu2x.
