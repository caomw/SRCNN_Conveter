# SRCNN (C++ Converter)
This is a simple reimplementation of [SRCNN](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/SRCNN.html), in C++, using OpenCV. 
SRCNN(Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network) is a super-resolution algorithm, you can use this converter for image scaling. 
## Simple Introduction
I write this converter in my undergraduate thesis project in March 2015. Inspired by [waifu2x](https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x), I decided to share my code in github and improve it.
